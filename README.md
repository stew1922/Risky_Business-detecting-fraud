## [Resampling](Instructions/Starter_Code/credit_risk_resampling.ipynb)
* Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?
    * The random oversampling had the best score at 0.649, however SMOTE and combination were both very, very close.
* Which model had the best recall score?
    * SMOTE had the best recall
* Which model had the best geometric mean score?
    * Random oversampling had the best geometric mean score


## [Ensemble Learning](Instructions/Starter_Code/credit_risk_ensemble.ipynb)
* Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?
    * Easy Ensemble had a much better BAS
* Which model had the best recall score?
    * Again, the Easy Ensemble had a much better recall
* Which model had the best geometric mean score?
    * Easy Ensemble takes the cake again
* What are the top three features?
    * loan_amt, int_rate, installment
